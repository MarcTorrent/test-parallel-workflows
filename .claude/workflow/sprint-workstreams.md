## Role Initialization

**START HERE** when beginning a new chat session for sprint work.

### Orchestrator Mode (Main Coordination Session)

**When to use**: You are coordinating multiple workstreams and handling sequential integration.

**Initialize with**:
```
/orchestrator
```

**This command**:
- Runs `pnpm sprint:orchestrate` to show current state
- Explains orchestrator responsibilities
- Provides sequential integration workflow
- Lists available sprint commands

**Your role**:
- ✅ Monitor progress across all workstreams
- ✅ Verify completed workstreams (each runs on different port)
- ✅ Run quality gates on completed workstreams
- ✅ Push workstreams to GitHub sequentially (one at a time)
- ✅ Sync all workstreams after each merge
- ✅ Handle merge conflicts
- ✅ Clean up worktrees when sprint complete
- ❌ DON'T work on individual tasks (that's for agents)

---

### Workstream Agent Mode (Task Implementation Session)

**When to use**: You are working on tasks within a specific workstream.

**Initialize with**:
```
/workstream-agent <workstream-name>
```

Example:
```
/workstream-agent <workstream-name>
```

**This command**:
- Runs `pnpm sprint:resume <name>` to load workstream info
- Navigates to worktree: `cd ../worktrees/<name>`
- Verifies location and branch
- Explains agent responsibilities
- Lists assigned tasks

**Your role**:
- ✅ Work ONLY on tasks assigned to your workstream
- ✅ Implement tasks sequentially (TDD workflow)
- ✅ Run quality gates before each commit
- ✅ Commit after each completed task
- ✅ Run `pnpm sprint:complete <name>` when ALL tasks done
- ✅ **FULL AUTONOMY** in your worktree - edit/create/delete files freely
- ✅ **Create subagents** for parallel tasks within your workstream
- ❌ DON'T push to GitHub (orchestrator does this)
- ❌ DON'T merge branches
- ❌ DON'T create PRs
- ❌ DON'T ask for permission to edit files (you have complete autonomy)

---

### Progress Tracking

**Workstream status is tracked in**: `.claude/sprint-config.json`

```json
{
  "workstreams": [
    {
      "name": "<workstream-name>",
      "status": "completed",           // ← Updated by sprint:complete
      "completedAt": "2025-10-26T15:15:47.000Z",  // ← Timestamp added
      "tasks": ["TASK-XXX", "TASK-YYY"],
      "worktree": "../worktrees/<workstream-name>/"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status values**:
- `"ready_to_start"` - Workstream created, no agent has started work
- `"pending"` - Agent has started work, tasks in progress (even if paused)
- `"in_progress"` - Agent actively working on tasks
- `"completed"` - Agent finished all tasks, ready for orchestrator
- `"ready_for_integration"` - Completed workstream ready for quality gates and push
- `"ready_for_push"` - Ready to push to GitHub
- `"merged"` - PR merged to develop
- `"merged_and_cleaned"` - Workstream merged and cleaned up

**Check progress**:
```bash
pnpm sprint:orchestrate  # Reads config, shows status
pnpm sprint:status       # Detailed git status per workstream
```

---

## Overview

### The Problem

Traditional feature branch workflows create bottlenecks when multiple workstreams can be parallelized:

- ❌ Each workstream requires separate PR creation
- ❌ Each PR requires manual GitHub UI interaction
- ❌ PR merges must be sequential
- ❌ Context switching via `git checkout` is slow
- ❌ Cannot run multiple dev servers simultaneously

### The Solution

**Sprint Workstreams with Worktrees** enables true parallelization:

- ✅ Multiple workstreams work simultaneously in isolated worktrees
- ✅ Each workstream has its own complete codebase
- ✅ **One PR per workstream** (not one per task)
- ✅ Instant context switching (`cd` instead of `git checkout`)
- ✅ Parallel dev servers on different ports
- ✅ Orchestrated integration with develop

---

## Core Concepts

### Directory Structure

The project uses a sibling directory structure for worktrees:

```
<your-workspace>/
├── test-parallel-workflows/     (main repository)
│   ├── .claude/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── ...
└── worktrees/                   (sibling directory, created automatically)
    ├── ui-components/           (worktree for ui-components workstream)
    ├── backend-api/             (worktree for backend-api workstream)
    └── testing/                 (worktree for testing workstream)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Worktrees are created in a `worktrees/` directory **sibling** to the main repository
- The exact path depends on where you cloned the repository
- All paths in documentation use relative paths (`../worktrees/<name>`) for portability
- Local developer-specific paths (like `.claude/settings.local.json`) are gitignored

### Workstream Definition

A workstream is a collection of related tasks that can be worked on by a single agent in sequence.

### Agent Assignment

Each workstream is assigned to a single agent who handles all tasks within that workstream sequentially.

### Worktree Strategy

Each workstream gets its own worktree (complete codebase copy), allowing multiple agents to work in parallel without conflicts.

### Integration Strategy

```
develop (remote origin)
├── feature/<workstream-1>-workstream (worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-1>/)
├── feature/<workstream-2>-workstream (worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-2>/)
├── feature/<workstream-3>-workstream (worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-3>/)
```

**Key Points:**

1. **Each worktree** is a complete copy of the codebase
2. **Each worktree** has its own branch
3. **Changes are isolated** until merge
4. **Orchestrator coordinates** when to push each workstream
5. **GitHub CI runs** on each workstream branch independently

## Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Sprint Analysis and Workstream Creation (Orchestrator)

**Analyze sprint and create workstreams:**

```bash
# Analyze sprint backlog for workstreams
pnpm sprint:analyze .claude/backlog/sprint-X-<name>.md
```

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 SPRINT WORKSTREAM ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WORKSTREAM 1: <workstream-1> (2 tasks - parallel safe)
   - TASK-XXX: <Task Description> (3 SP)
   - TASK-YYY: <Task Description> (2 SP)

   Dependencies: None
   File conflicts: None detected
   Agent: <agent-type>
   Worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-1>/

✅ WORKSTREAM 2: <workstream-2> (2 tasks - sequential)
   - TASK-ZZZ: <Task Description> (3 SP)
   - TASK-AAA: <Task Description> (2 SP)

   Dependencies: None
   File conflicts: None detected
   Agent: <agent-type>
   Worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-2>/

✅ WORKSTREAM 3: <workstream-3> (1 task - independent)
   - TASK-BBB: <Task Description> (2 SP)

   Dependencies: TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY, TASK-ZZZ, TASK-AAA
   File conflicts: None detected
   Agent: <agent-type>
   Worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-3>/

💡 RECOMMENDATION: Use workstream parallelization
   Command: pnpm sprint:create-workstreams .claude/backlog/sprint-X-<name>.md
```

**Create workstreams:**

```bash
# Create all workstreams and worktrees
pnpm sprint:create-workstreams .claude/backlog/sprint-X-<name>.md
```

**What happens:**

1. Creates worktrees: `../worktrees/<workstream-1>/`, `../worktrees/<workstream-2>/`, etc.
2. Creates branches: `feature/<workstream-1>-workstream`, `feature/<workstream-2>-workstream`, etc.
3. Updates sprint file with workstream status
4. **Stops here** - prompts you to choose execution mode

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ WORKSTREAMS CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 WORKSTREAMS READY:
- <workstream-1>: ../worktrees/<workstream-1>/
- <workstream-2>: ../worktrees/<workstream-2>/
- <workstream-3>: ../worktrees/<workstream-3>/

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
Choose execution mode:

Option A: Manual subinstances (Cursor)
- Create new chat instances manually
- Each instance runs: pnpm sprint:resume <workstream-name>

Option B: Subagents (Claude Code)
- Subagents take worktrees and work on them
- Each subagent can create sub-subagents for parallel tasks within workstream
```

### Phase 2: Workstream Execution (Subinstances/Subagents)

**Each agent works in their assigned worktree with FULL AUTONOMY:**

**🚀 IMPORTANT**: Agents have **complete autonomy** in their worktree. They can:
- Edit/create/delete any files without asking permission
- Install dependencies, modify configs, refactor code freely
- Create subagents for parallel tasks within their workstream
- Commit directly without approval (only push is restricted)

```bash
# ━━━ SUBINSTANCE 1: <workstream-1> ━━━
cd ../worktrees/<workstream-1>/
pnpm install
pnpm dev --port 3001

# ... develop features ...
# Work on TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY sequentially
# NO PERMISSION NEEDED - work autonomously!

pnpm test run
pnpm type-check
pnpm lint
pnpm build

git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement <workstream-1> workstream (TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY)

- Implemented <feature description>
- <additional changes>
- All tests passing

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# ✅ DONE - NO PUSH TO REMOTE YET
# Report completion to orchestrator
```

**Meanwhile, other agents work in parallel:**

```bash
# ━━━ SUBINSTANCE 2: <workstream-2> ━━━
cd ../worktrees/<workstream-2>/
pnpm dev --port 3002
# ... work on TASK-ZZZ, then TASK-AAA ...

# ━━━ SUBINSTANCE 3: <workstream-3> ━━━
cd ../worktrees/<workstream-3>/
pnpm dev --port 3003
# ... work on TASK-BBB ...

# All 3 agents working simultaneously!
```

### Phase 3: Workstream Completion (Subinstances/Subagents)

**When workstream is complete:**

```bash
# Subinstance/subagent completes workstream
pnpm sprint:complete <workstream-name>
```

**What happens:**

1. Updates sprint file: workstream status = "Ready to Push"
2. Shows completion summary
3. Reports to orchestrator

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ WORKSTREAM COMPLETE: <workstream-name>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tasks completed: 2/2
- ✅ TASK-XXX: <Task Description>
- ✅ TASK-YYY: <Task Description>

Status: Ready to Push
Worktree: ../worktrees/<workstream-name>/
Branch: feature/<workstream-name>-workstream

📝 NEXT STEPS:
Orchestrator should run: pnpm sprint:push <workstream-name>
```

### Phase 4: Orchestrator Push (Orchestrator)

**Push workstream to GitHub:**

```bash
# Orchestrator pushes workstream
pnpm sprint:push <workstream-name>
```

**What happens:**

1. Pushes `feature/<workstream-name>-workstream` to GitHub
2. Outputs PR creation URL
3. Provides pre-filled PR title and description
4. Updates sprint file: status = "Pushed"

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ WORKSTREAM PUSHED: <workstream-name>
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Branch pushed: feature/<workstream-name>-workstream
PR URL: https://github.com/.../compare/develop...feature/<workstream-name>-workstream

📋 PR TITLE:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 NEXT STEPS:
  1. Open PR URL in browser (link above)
  2. Paste PR title and description (provided above)
  3. Create pull request on GitHub
  4. Wait for GitHub Actions to validate
  5. Review and merge PR when ready
  6. Run: pnpm sprint:sync-all (to sync other workstreams)
```

### Phase 5: GitHub Actions Validation (Automatic)

**GitHub Actions run on the workstream branch:**

All checks must pass (same as regular PRs).

### Phase 6: Merge PR (You)

**In GitHub UI:**

1. Review the PR (see all workstream tasks integrated)
2. Verify all checks passed ✅
3. Click "Merge pull request"
4. Workstream branch merged to `develop`


### Phase 7: Orchestrator Sync (Orchestrator)

**After PR is merged, sync all other workstreams:**

```bash
# Orchestrator updates local develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Sync all other workstreams with updated develop
pnpm sprint:sync-all
```

**What happens:**

1. Updates local develop with merged changes
2. Syncs all other workstreams with updated develop
3. Resolves conflicts if any
4. Updates sprint file with sync status

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ WORKSTREAMS SYNCED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Updated develop with <workstream-name> changes
Synced workstreams: 2/2
- ✅ <workstream-2>: Synced with develop
- ✅ <workstream-3>: Synced with develop

✨ All workstreams are up-to-date with develop!
```

### Phase 8: Continue Work (Subinstances/Subagents)

**Other workstreams continue with updated develop:**

```bash
# Subinstance continues work
cd ../worktrees/<workstream-2>/
# Now has <workstream-1> changes + <workstream-2> changes
# Continue working on TASK-ZZZ, TASK-AAA
```

### Phase 9: Repeat Process

**Repeat phases 3-8 for each workstream:**

1. Complete workstream
2. Push workstream
3. GitHub Actions validation
4. Merge PR
5. Sync all other workstreams
6. Continue work

### Phase 10: Incremental Cleanup (Orchestrator) ⭐ NEW

**After each workstream is merged (recommended approach):**

```bash
# After PR merged, clean up THIS workstream immediately
pnpm sprint:cleanup-workstream <workstream-name>
```

**What happens:**

1. Validates workstream is completed and merged
2. Removes worktree for this workstream
3. Deletes local branch (remote branch preserved for history)
4. Updates config: status = "merged_and_cleaned"
5. Syncs remaining workstreams with develop

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ WORKSTREAM CLEANUP COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Workstream: <workstream-name>
Worktree removed: ✅
Branch deleted: ✅
Status: merged_and_cleaned

✨ Workstream cleaned up successfully!

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
   🔄 Run: pnpm sprint:sync-all (to sync remaining workstreams)
   📊 Run: pnpm sprint:status (to check remaining workstreams)
```

**Benefits of Incremental Cleanup:**

- ✅ Cleaner workspace (don't accumulate 5 worktrees)
- ✅ Less disk space used
- ✅ Clear what's "done" vs "in progress"
- ✅ Can't accidentally work in merged workstream
- ✅ Simpler final cleanup (nothing left to do)

**Updated Sequential Integration Workflow:**

```bash
# After PR merged:
1. git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
2. pnpm sprint:cleanup-workstream <workstream-name>  # ← NEW
3. pnpm sprint:sync-all  # Sync remaining workstreams
4. Ready for next workstream
```

### Phase 11: Final Cleanup (Orchestrator)

**After all workstreams are complete (if using incremental cleanup):**

```bash
# Clean up any remaining worktrees (should be few)
pnpm sprint:cleanup
```

**What happens:**

1. Confirms all workstreams are complete
2. Syncs `develop` branch (`git pull`)
3. Removes any remaining worktrees
4. Deletes any remaining local workstream branches
5. Updates sprint file with completion status

**Example Output:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ SPRINT CLEANUP COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Worktrees removed: 0 (already cleaned incrementally)
Branches deleted: 0 (already cleaned incrementally)
Current branch: develop (up to date)

✨ Sprint 1 workstreams completed successfully!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts During Sync

**Problem**: Conflict when syncing workstream with develop

**Solution**:

1. Script pauses and shows conflict files
2. Manually resolve conflicts in workstream:
   ```bash
   cd ../worktrees/<workstream-name>/
   git status  # See conflicting files
   # Edit files to resolve conflicts
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts with develop"
   ```
3. Re-run `pnpm sprint:sync <workstream-name>` to continue

### Port Already in Use

**Problem**: Dev server can't start on assigned port

**Solution**:

1. Check what's using the port:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   ```
2. Kill the process or use different port:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev --port 3010  # Use alternative port
   ```

### Worktree Directory Not Found

**Problem**: Can't find `../worktrees/<workstream-name>/`

**Solution**:

1. Check if worktree was created:
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```
2. Verify path is correct (relative to main repo)
3. Re-run `pnpm sprint:create-workstreams` if needed

### GitHub Actions Failing on Workstream Branch

**Problem**: CI/CD checks fail on `feature/<workstream-name>-workstream` branch

**Solution**:

1. Same as any failing PR - fix the issues
2. Commit fixes to workstream branch
3. Push again: `git push origin feature/<workstream-name>-workstream`
4. GitHub Actions re-run automatically

---

## Best Practices

### Workstream Design

1. **Related tasks**: Group tasks that work on similar files
2. **Clear dependencies**: Identify sequential vs parallel tasks
3. **Agent expertise**: Assign workstreams to appropriate agents
4. **File isolation**: Minimize file conflicts between workstreams

### Orchestration

1. **Sequential integration**: Push workstreams one at a time
2. **Post-merge sync**: Always sync other workstreams after merge
3. **Conflict prevention**: Monitor file changes across workstreams
4. **Quality gates**: Ensure all tests pass before push

### Agent Coordination

1. **Clear communication**: Report workstream status to orchestrator
2. **Incremental commits**: Commit work frequently within workstream
3. **Test coverage**: Maintain 80% test coverage within workstream
4. **Documentation**: Update sprint file with workstream progress

### Performance

1. **Port management**: Use different ports for each workstream
2. **Resource usage**: Monitor disk space for multiple worktrees
3. **Build optimization**: Use incremental builds within workstreams
4. **Cache sharing**: Share node_modules between worktrees when possible
